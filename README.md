# A pixel-perfect 2D kinematic character controller for Unity projects
## Overview
I got tired of making a new controller for every project I start and wanted to create one for general use, specifically for 2D pixel-perfect games.
This is the result. I hope it is useful to anyone that comes across it, either as a learning device or a stepping stone for their own project.
